    <h3>#autosub Make new start mode to choose between auto-start or data-router</h3> 
    <p></p> 
    <p>Added parameter `subtitle_start_mode` into settings file `ApplicationSettings.json` to define the service behavior at startup</p> 
    <p></p> 
    <p>`subtitle_start_mode` can have 2 modes</p> 
    <p></p> 
    <pre>
<code>
 0 - Waits for the command to start transcription from DataRuter, which connects to the AutoSub service via gRPC 
 1 - Transcription starts automatically after the service starts. 
     In this case, the transcription language is taken from a file `SpeechmaticsSettings.json` `speechmatics.language`
