### Move to the next line if added symbol is punctuation

During the process of filling subtitle lines, when adding a new word to the `Subtitle Buffer`.`Current subtitle`, we check whether the word ends with a punctuation mark such as `. ? ! ;`. If it does, we complete the current line and move to the next one. During this process, we also check the following conditions:

- If the word is at the beginning of the current line and there is space in the previous line, we add the word to the end of the previous line.
- If the word is at the beginning of the current line and there is no space in the previous line, we move the last word from the previous line to the current line. This prevents the line from starting with a punctuation mark, thereby improving readability.

The same rule applies to the characters `, ( ) [ ]`, except that after adding such a word, there is no transition to the next line.
