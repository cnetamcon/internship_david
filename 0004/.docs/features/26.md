### Change subtitle delivery process. Wait until the subtitle is fully filled

The `Extract` method, which extracts subtitles from the `Subtitle Buffer` and sends them to the designated destination, is called every `subtitles_timeout_ms` milliseconds.

However, since a subtitle is formed from received words, we need to account for potential delays in filling the `Subtitle Buffer`.`Current subtitle`. To handle this while ensuring the last subtitle isn't lost, the `subtitle_extract_attempts` parameter has been added. This parameter defines the number of attempts to extract a subtitle when the `Subtitle Buffer`.`Collection of formed subtitles` is empty, but there are still words in the **current subtitle**.

If no new words are received during the specified `subtitle_extract_attempts` calls to the `Extract` method, the **current subtitle** is forcibly moved to the **Collection of formed subtitles**.
