### #autosub Make new start mode to choose between auto-start or data-router

Added parameter `subtitle_start_mode` into settings file `ApplicationSettings.json` to define the service behavior
at startup

`subtitle_start_mode` can have 2 modes

```
0 - Waits for the command to start transcription from DataRuter, which connects to the AutoSub service via gRPC
1 - Transcription starts automatically after the service starts.
    In this case, the transcription language is taken from a file `SpeechmaticsSettings.json` `speechmatics.language`
```
