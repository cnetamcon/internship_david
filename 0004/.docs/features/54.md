### #autosub Getting speaker fullname from external api

Added `speaker_api` section in the `SpeechmaticsSettings.json`

```json
{
  "speaker_api": {
    "uri": "http://192.168.101.99:8082/jobs/GetSpeaker",
    "model": "test",
    "stream_name": "test"
  }
}
```

To deactivate requests to the API, simply specify an empty uri string.

```json
{
  "speaker_api": {
    "uri": "",
    "model": "test",
    "stream_name": "test"
  }
}
```

Upon receiving the transcription, the process of audio stream analysis and voice recognition by a third-party API is launched. On the third-party API, pre-prepared models allow us to match the voice with the speaker's name.

We need to send to the third-party API

1. Model - Trained model name
2. StreamName - Name of the audio stream for analysis
3. TcIn - Start time of analysis in UNIX seconds time
4. TcOut - End time of analysis in UNIX seconds time

In response, we receive the name of the speaker, such as `Jean Dupont`, and match it with the speaker's ID.

We get the following:

- Speaker: `S1`
- Fullname: `Jean Dupont`
- Shortname: `J. Dupont`

Next, if there is a received name for speaker `S1`, we substitute the full name for the first mention and ShortName for subsequent mentions.

If a name for speaker `S1` is received, no repeat requests are sent.
