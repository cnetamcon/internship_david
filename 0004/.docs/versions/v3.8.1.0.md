### #autosub Make new recording mode only last transcription 

Changed ApplicationSettings.json file. Added settings `subtitle_latest_path`:

```
subtitle_write_mode - Choose what to do with the received transcriptions
    0: Send via TCP or UDP as Newfor
    1: Write to file as SRT
    2: Write to file as plain text the latest subtitle

subtitle_srt_path - if subtitle_write_mode is 1, this is the path to the SRT file
subtitle_latest_path - if subtitle_write_mode is 2, this is the path to write receved subtitle
```

If `subtitle_write_mode = 2` we write the received transcriptions to the file specified in `subtitle_latest_path`. We write only latest generated subtitle every time.
