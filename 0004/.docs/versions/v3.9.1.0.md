### #autosub Add a speaker confidence threshold

Added two parameters `confidence_threshold` and `unrecognized_speaker_name` to settings file `SpeechmaticsSettings.json`

```json
"speaker_api": {
  "uri": "http://192.168.101.52:18082/jobs/GetSpeaker",
  "model": "politicsV1",
  "stream_name": "SRC/EXT2",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.98,
  "unrecognized_speaker_name": "Unrecognized"
}
```

If the remote api returns a speaker with the `confidence` value less then `confidence_threshold` when recognizing a speaker, we set the speaker name from the `unrecognized_speaker` settings.

In the subtitles for the speaker `S1`, the name from `unrecognized_speaker` will be matched, but on the next iteration, an attempt will be made to get the name from the remote api again.


### #autosub Add char before speaker name (char should be in conf file)

Added two parameters `speaker_prefix` to settings file `SpeechmaticsSettings.json`

```json
"speaker_api": {
  "uri": "http://192.168.101.52:18082/jobs/GetSpeaker",
  "model": "politicsV1",
  "stream_name": "SRC/EXT2",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.98,
  "unrecognized_speaker_name": "Unrecognized",
  "speaker_prefix": "- "
}
```
