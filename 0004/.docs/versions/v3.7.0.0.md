## Features:

### Subtitles Live Service (ALSService)

The calculation of lines for generating subtitles has been changed. Instead of using 3 lines by default, the number of lines is calculated based on those specified in the configuration file:
`ApplicationSettings.json`
```
 "subtitle_lines": "8,14"
```

### DataRouter. Changing Line Numbers for Subtitles Live Service

![](../attachments/Screenshot_4683.png)
- Added display of line numbers from ALS Service settings. Added "Up" and "Down" buttons to the subtitles panel
- Minimum value - 2
- Maximum value - 22
- When you click on the "Down" button, the minimum line increases by +2. All subsequent lines are recalculated taking into account +2 from the original line
- When you click on the "Up" button, the minimum line is reduced by 2. All subsequent lines are recalculated taking into account +2 from the original line
Example:
1. Current value is "4, 20"
2. Click on the "Down" button
3. New value "6, 8"

### DataRouter. Changing subtitle color for Subtitles Live Service

A button has been added to the subtitle panel interface to change the color of Auto-Sub subtitles for speaker "S1".
