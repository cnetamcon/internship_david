### #autosub Make separate replaceByteDictionnary for the SRT and Sub.txt output

Settings file `ReplaceByteDictionary.json` was renamed to `ReplaceByteDictionaryForNewfor.json`

Added settings file `ReplaceByteDictionaryForSimpleText.json` to replace bytes in received transcription in `ApplicationSettings.json` `subtitle_write_mode` 1 and 2.


### #autosub Generate Newfor start depend on lines amount

Changed the construction of the Newfor subtitle.

**Before:**

The subtitle always starts with `0x8F 0x02`

**After:**

If the subtitle contains one line - Newfor starts with `0x8F 0xC7`

If the subtitle contains two or more lines - Newfor starts with `0x8F 0x8C`
