### #autosub The first line of each subtitle should start with the speaker name

Added `use_speaker_in_subtitle` `(boolean)` parameter in the `ApplicationSettings.json` settings file to activate speaker name in subtitle.

```json
{
  "subtitle_use_speaker": true
}
```

Added parameter `subtitle_use_speaker` responsible for embedding the speaker's name at the beginning of the subtitle.

If `"subtitle_use_speaker": true` Then each subtitle starts with the speaker's name if recognized. `Speechmatics` allows us to recognize different speakers. Each speaker is assigned an id - `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, etc.

For each speaker, we try to recognize their name using another API and match it with the id from `Speechmatics`.

- If **speaker** occurs for the first time - its full name is used.
- If **speaker** has already occurred before - its short name is used.
- If **speaker** does not have its full and short name set - its id is used: `S1:`.
