### Modify Automation and the Sequence "StreamPrepare" / "StreamExecute" / "StreamStop"

---

We can get the commands from the following script:

```
Prepare STL Channel1, file1
Execute STL Channel1, file1
Prepare STL Channel1, file1
Stop Channel1
Execute STL Channel1, file1
Stop Channel1
```

or

```
Prepare STL Channel1, file1
Execute STL Channel1, file1
Prepare STL Channel1, file2
Stop Channel1
Execute STL Channel1, file2
Stop Channel1
```

If we receive the Prepare command even though we have already executed the Prepare command with the following AutomationId AND ChannelId - We change the values of the file name and timecode that came in the command, but ignore the next Stop command for this AutomationId & ChannelId.

Process of the Stream Prepare Command 0x10

1. LACI Bind
2. Change IsActive status to False
3. Set STL file info
4. Set STL entry timecode

Process of the Stream Execute Command 0x11

1. LACI Enable
2. Change IsActive status to True
3. Set STL file info
4. Set STL entry timecode

Process of the Stream Stop Command 0x12

1. We check if there was a repeated Prepare command - skip processing
2. LACI Disable
3. LACI Unbind
4. Change IsActive status to False
