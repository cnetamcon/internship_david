## #49 #autosub Change line completing mechanism to add check length of latest two words

---

when you have a line completed, we look at the last two words, we call them N-1 and N:
if N&gt;3, we do nothing.
If N&lt;=3, we look at N-1:
              if N-1&gt;2 : we move N word to the next line
              if N-1&lt;=2: we move N-1 and N words to the next line
