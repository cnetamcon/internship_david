Modify Automation and the Sequence "StreamPrepare" / "StreamExecute" / "StreamStop"

---

It is linked to the control with Automation and the Sequence "StreamPrepare" / "StreamExecute" / StreamStop"

Sometimes, we will have this:

Prepare
Execute
Prepare
Stop
Execute
Stop

It seems to me that we already manage this when we have a STL file which is created and it is the same STL file.

But we need now to do it a little bit different.

When we have this

Prepare STL1
Execute STL1
Prepare STL1
Stop
Execute STL1
Stop

We need: not to do the Stop in the middle. We keep all active. So when we receive Prepare but already active, we don't do anythin on the next stop

When we have this

Prepare STL1
Execute STL1
Prepare STL2
Stop
Execute STL2
Stop

We need: not to do the Stop in the middle. We keep all active.
BUT we need to change STL file from STL1 to STL2
So when we receive Prepare but already active, we don't do anythin on the next stop AND we change the STL file we are using to write new entry

Если мы получаем команду Prepare при том, что у нас уже была выполнена команда Prepare с такими AutomationId AND ChannelId - Мы меняем значения названия файла и timecode который пришел в команде, но игнорируем следующую команду Stop для этого AutomationId & ChannelId.
