## Features

### #autosub Make new start mode to choose between auto-start or data-router

Added parameter `subtitle_start_mode` into settings file `ApplicationSettings.json` to define the service behavior at startup

`subtitle_start_mode` can have 2 modes

```
0 - Waits for the command to start transcription from DataRuter, which connects to the AutoSub service via gRPC
1 - Transcription starts automatically after the service starts.
    In this case, the transcription language is taken from a file `SpeechmaticsSettings.json` `speechmatics.language`
```

### #autosub Create a new subtitle generation mode. Keep latest line or generation new lines

Added parameter `subtitle_gen_line_mode` into settings file `ApplicationSettings.json` to define the service behavior to build a new subtitle when all lines for subtitle is full - for the next subtitle

`subtitle_gen_line_mode` can have 2 modes

0 - Remove first line. This will move all lines up one position
1 - Remove all lines. We wait until all the lines are filled in
