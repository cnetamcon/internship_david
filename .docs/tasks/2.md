### #0002 Write a console application that will parse a binary file and find the time in it observing certain conditions

---

To view the contents of the playlist.plst file, you can use a hex editor - https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/

Write a console application that will parse a binary file and find time in it, observing certain conditions.

At the input, the program takes two parameters

1. path to the binary file playlist.plst
2. path to which the text file with the parsing result will be saved

Algorithm of actions:

1. Read all bytes from the file
2. Divide the total array into subarrays. Separator 0x80 0x01
3. Go through each subarray
   3.1 Find and shift past the byte position 0x53, 0x43, 0x54, 0x45, 0x31, 0x30, 0x34 (SCTE104)
   If not found, move to the next subarray
   3.2 Find and shift past the byte position 0x73 0x63 0x74 0x65 (scte)
   3.3 Look for occurrence 0x54 0x3D 0x33 0x34 (T=34)
   If not found, move to the next subarray
   3.4 Find and shift past the last occurrence of byte 0x0d 0x0A
   3.5 Check that the following bytes are 0x00 0x00
   If if we don't find it, we move to the next subarray
   3.6 We shift by 43 bytes
   3.7 We read 4 bytes.
   These 4 bytes are the time in BSD format - Frame, Second, Minute, Hour which must be converted to a string
   Example BCD: 0x20 0x11 0x23 0x15 means that Frame=20, Second=11, Minutes=23 Hours=15, and we get the time in the format 15:23:11:20

After this, you need to save the parsing information to a text file.Result file format:

```
Start time: {start time of analysis}

File: {path to .plst файлу}
Time: {timecode}

Finish time: {end time of analysis}

```

Example:

```
Start time: 2021.01.01 15:00:00.000

File: C:\temp\playlist.plst
Time: 15:23:11:20

Finish time: 2021.01.01 15:00:00.112
```
